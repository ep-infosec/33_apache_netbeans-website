Apache NetBeans can also be installed as a self-contained link:https://snapcraft.io/netbeans[snap package] on Linux.

== Community Installers

IMPORTANT: Individual NetBeans committers may provide additional binary packages as a convenience.
While built using the Apache NetBeans release, they are not releases of the Apache Software
Foundation. They may include other contents (eg. JDK) under additional license terms.

- link:https://www.codelerity.com/netbeans/[Codelerity / Gj IT packages] - Windows, macOS and
Linux (.deb / .AppImage) built with
link:https://github.com/apache/netbeans-tools/tree/master/nbpackage[NBPackage]. Most
include a local JDK runtime for the IDE to run on, for a self-contained out-of-the-box
experience (other JDK's may be used for projects).

== Deployment Platforms

The Apache NetBeans 13 binary releases require JDK 11+, and officially support running on JDK 11 and JDK 17.

TIP: The current JDKs have an issue on macOS Big Sur, that causes freezes on dialogs. That could be fixed by applying the workaround described at link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NETBEANS-5037?focusedCommentId=17234878&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-17234878[NETBEANS-5037] .

== Building from Source

To build Apache NetBeans 13 from source you need:

. A distribution of OpenJDK 8 or 11.
. Apache Ant 1.10 or greater (link:https://ant.apache.org[https://ant.apache.org]).

Once you have everything installed then:

1. Unzip link:https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/netbeans/netbeans/13/netbeans-13-source.zip[netbeans-13-source.zip]
in a directory of your liking.

[start=2]
. `cd` to that directory, and then run `ant` to build the Apache NetBeans IDE.
Once built you can run the IDE by typing `./nbbuild/netbeans/bin/netbeans`
