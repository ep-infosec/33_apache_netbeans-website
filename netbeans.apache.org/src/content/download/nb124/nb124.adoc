== Deployment Platforms

Apache NetBeans 12.4 runs on JDK LTS releases 8 and 11, as well as on JDK 16, i.e., the current JDK release at the time of this NetBeans release.

TIP: The current JDKs have an issue on macOS Big Sur, that causes freezes on dialogs. That could be fixed by applying the workaround described at link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NETBEANS-5037?focusedCommentId=17234878&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-17234878[NETBEANS-5037] .

== Building from Source

To build Apache NetBeans 12.4 from source you need:

. A distribution of OpenJDK 8 or 11.
. Apache Ant 1.10 or greater (link:https://ant.apache.org[https://ant.apache.org]).

Once you have everything installed then:

1. Unzip link:https://archive.apache.org/dist/netbeans/netbeans/12.4/netbeans-12.4-source.zip[netbeans-12.4-source.zip]
in a directory of your liking.

[start=2]
. `cd` to that directory, and then run `ant` to build the Apache NetBeans IDE.
Once built you can run the IDE by typing `./nbbuild/netbeans/bin/netbeans`
