Apache NetBeans (incubating) 11.0 was announced on April the 4th, 2019.
See xref:index.adoc[Apache NetBeans 11.0 Features] for a full list of features.

TIP: Since releasing 11.0, feature updates, that is, Apache NetBeans 11.1, 11.2, and 11.3 have been released. The LTS release of the Apache NetBeans 11 cycle is Apache NetBeans 11.0. The feature releases have not been tested as heavily as the LTS release and may therefore be less stable. Use 11.1, 11.2, and 11.3 to use the latest features and to provide feedback for the next LTS release, scheduled for 2020. Go here to download xref:../nb113/nb113.adoc[Apache NetBeans 11.3], the latest feature update in the 11 cycle, which needs to be installed instead of 11.0, i.e., there is no automatic update between releases.

. Oracle's Java 8 or Open JDK v8.
. Apache Ant 1.10 or greater (link:https://ant.apache.org[https://ant.apache.org]).

Once you have everything installed then:

1. Unzip link:https://archive.apache.org/dist/incubator/netbeans/incubating-netbeans/incubating-11.0/incubating-netbeans-11.0-source.zip[incubating-netbeans-11.0-source.zip] in a directory of your liking.
2. `cd` to that directory, and then run `ant` to build the Apache NetBeans IDE. Once built you can run the IDE by typing `./nbbuild/netbeans/bin/netbeans`
