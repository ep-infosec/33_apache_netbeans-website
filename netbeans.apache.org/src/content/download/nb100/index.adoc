Apache NetBeans (incubating) 10.0 is the second major release of the Apache NetBeans IDE. It was released in December, 2018. xref:nb100.adoc[Click here to download] this release.

This release is focused in adding support for JDK 11, JUnit 5, PHP, JavaScript and Groovy, as well in solving many issues.


////
To display a feature do as follows:

Add a header title, and an anonymous asciidoc block (--) with the ".feature" metadata, and write text inside the block:

== A title here
[.feature]

You can add images to the feature by adding a png file along with the document, and adding a image: construct to the text.

Use role="left" for left alignment or role="right" for right alignment.

Examples:

Here goes some text

And some more text

for more details on PHP support.


== JUnit 5

[.feature]
--

JUnit 5.3.1 has been added as a new Library to NetBeans, so you can quickly add
it to your Java projects. For Maven projects without existing tests, JUnit 5
is now the default JUnit version.

image:nb100-junit5-library-small.png[JUnit 5 Library, role="left", link="nb100-junit5-library.png"]

The JUnit 5 `@Testable` annotation is also supported. Any method that includes
an annotation that inherits from this, will be allowed to be executed with
these action menu items.

Default JUnit 5 Test Template provided out of the box. Note JUnit 5 doesn't
currently support test suite's for its Jupiter engine, so the template provided
will attempt to create a test suite using the Vintage engine.
