|This screencast shows how to generate PHP documentation using PHPDocumentor with NetBeans IDE. Built-in support for PHPDocumentor was added in NetBeans IDE 7.0. The screencast includes details of installing PHPDocumentor with PEAR and configuring PHPDocumentor, NetBeans IDE and your php.ini file. This video is especially useful for developers using NetBeans on a Microsoft Windows operating system.

*Warning:* PHPDocumentor does not fully support PHP 5.3. Namespaces and some other 5.3 features are not documented by PHP Documentor.
