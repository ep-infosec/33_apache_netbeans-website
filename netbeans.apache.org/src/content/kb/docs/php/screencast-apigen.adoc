|This screencast shows how to generate PHP documentation using ApiGen with NetBeans IDE. Built-in support for ApiGen was added in NetBeans IDE 7.2. The screencast includes details of installing ApiGen with PEAR and a simple example of use.

NOTE: ApiGen replaces PHPDocumentor as the documentation tool of choice for NetBeans IDE. You can still use PHPDocumentor if you prefer. Install the PHPDocumentor plugins from Tools > Plugins, and link:http://bits.netbeans.org/media/phpdoc.flv[+download this video+].
